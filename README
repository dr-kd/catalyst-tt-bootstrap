Example Catalyst (http://catalystframework.org) app that uses Template
Toolkit and Twitter Bootstrap for HTML display.  The MyBoot::View::Web
config, and the Page.tt (wrapper) are probably the only really useful bits
of this app.

To use the latest twitter bootstrap, grab the latest release from
http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/bootstrap.zip, put in your app's
'root/static' directory and unzip.

Run script/myboot_server.pl to test the application.
